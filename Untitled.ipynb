    "One day, a crocodile named Karalamukha spotted Raktamukha enjoying the ripe mangoes from the riverbank. Karalamukha was drawn to the monkey's delightful feasts and longed to taste the sweet fruit himself. He approached Raktamukha and struck up a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dear Raktamukha,\" said Karalamukha, \"I have heard of your exquisite mangoes. Would you be so kind as to share some with me? My wife is pregnant, and she has a strong craving for mangoes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Raktamukha, being wise, sensed the crocodile's ulterior motive but decided to play along. \"Certainly, dear friend,\" replied Raktamukha with a smile. \"Hop onto my back, and I will carry you across the river to the mango grove on the other side, where the mangoes are even sweeter.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Delighted by the monkey's offer, Karalamukha climbed onto Raktamukha's back, and they began their journey across the river. As they reached the middle of the river, Karalamukha confessed his true intention to Raktamukha.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dear monkey,\" said Karalamukha, \"I must apologize for deceiving you. I plan to feed you to my wife, for she desires to taste monkey's heart, believing it will ensure a healthy baby.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon hearing this treacherous plan, Raktamukha remained calm and composed. \"Oh, dear friend,\" replied Raktamukha, \"I understand your predicament. However, I have left my heart hanging on the mango tree. If you desire to feed it to your wife, we must return to the tree at once.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Believing the monkey's words, Karalamukha turned back towards the mango tree. As they reached the riverbank, Raktamukha swiftly leaped onto the tree's branches, out of the crocodile's reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realizing he had been outwitted by the clever monkey, Karalamukha felt ashamed and begged for forgiveness. But Raktamukha, being compassionate, forgave the crocodile and continued to enjoy his days in the mango tree, always keeping an eye out for any future trickery.\n",
